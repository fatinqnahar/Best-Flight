Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s new security chief co-authored a report two years ago suggesting that the solution to Chicago’s crime problem on the city’s South and West sides was this: Bring in the National Guard.

Former U.S. Marshal James Smith, the private security contractor whom Lightfoot picked to head her security detail, wrote the eight-page report in 2017 with former Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Milan.

Milan recalled Wednesday that the two were trying to find a solution for the spiraling violence in certain Chicago neighborhoods but said that the proposal never came to pass. He said that they discussed the idea with a member of President Donald Trump’s administration and with officials in former Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s administration but that officials thought it was “too extreme.”

The proposal, which was first publicized in news reports in 2017, called for deploying 4,000 to 8,000 National Guard troops to parts of the South and West sides. Many street and alley entrances and exits to neighborhoods such as Englewood were to be blocked off, with troops posted at the unblocked streets from 7 p.m. to 4 a.m. to stand watch, according to the report.

Later Wednesday, Milan said the proposal to bring in the National Guard “was mostly my idea, not Jim’s.”

“(Smith) mostly wanted to involve the U.S. Marshals and other agencies,” Milan said.
