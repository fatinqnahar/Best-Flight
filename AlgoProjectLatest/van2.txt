Canadians are scheduled to vote in a federal election on Oct. 21, although it could come earlier
Pamela Goldsmith-Jones, MP for West Vancouver–Sunshine Coast–Sea to Sky Country, announced Wednesday that she will not seek re-election in October.

Liberal MP Goldsmith-Jones, 58, wrestled the traditionally Conservative riding away from two-term MP John Weston in 2015. She made the announcement Wednesday in a letter to constituents which said she had advised Prime Minister Justin Trudeau she would not be running again.

“Serving as your MP and representing Canada on world issues has been a distinct honour,” Goldsmith-Jones said.

“However, when I look forward to the next four years, I feel that need to spend time closer to home, particularly with my parents.”

Goldsmith-Jones said she would continue to serve as MP until the election. She will remain as parliamentary secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, a post to which she was appointed last August after previously serving as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of International Trade Diversification.

“I believe strongly in Prime Minister Trudeau and in our Liberal team,”Goldsmith-Jones said.

“Going into the next election, I will do all I can to help ensure we have an outstanding candidate and that the Liberal Party continues to have a strong voice in western Canada.”

Goldsmith-Jones was a veteran of North Shore municipal politics and in 2015 easily won the traditionally Conservative riding away from two-term MP John Weston.

Her 12-year municipal government career including stints as a city councillor in North Vancouver and West Vancouver, and two terms as mayor of West Vancouver (2005-2011).

Goldsmith-Jones stepped away from politics in 2011 to complete her executive MBA at Simon Fraser University, specializing in Aboriginal business and leadership.
