Hong Kong is preparing for the worst.
The adverse impact on Hong Kong from the 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods will not be felt immediately, the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Edward Yau, said today.

He said, however, the additional tariffs imposed by the US would pose “a very negative impact on trade and our economy.''

“We see in the first quarter, [the] export trade decreased at 2.4 percent. Although the business sentiment has taken up in early months of this year, it would be dampened with this additional [tariffs] measure.

“As to how hard it would hit Hong Kong's economy, I think it's yet to tell because the negotiation between the US and China is still going on and we still hope that there would be positive developments.''
