Police officers fired nine shots at a suspect’s vehicle, wrested a gun out of the wanted man’s hands, then disarmed him again when he pulled a belt knife and cut an officers arm in Banqiao District, New Taipei City, today, May 5.

At around 3:00pm, police officers approached a black BMW sedan illegally parked in Lane 188, Wenhua Road, and recognized a 36-year-old driver as a suspect named Yeh (?), wanted on drugs charges.

Yeh attempted to run the police officers down and escape, but an officer shot out the front-left and rear tires of the vehicle. As Yeh pull out a handgun, another officer charged through the driver’s window to wrest the gun out of the suspect’s hands.

After the officer opened the door to pull the suspect out of the vehicle, Yeh pulled a belt knife, cutting the police officer on the left arm before the officer ripped the belt and knife out of his hands, and backed away from the vehicle.

Yeh then attempted to run, but was tackled by the police officer. A struggle then ensued before the suspect was finally restrained and handcuffed.

Yeh was found to be in possession of a modified pistol with four rounds of ammunition, 3.94 grams of heroin, and 1.62 grams of amphetamine.

Yeh was handed over to the District Prosecutor’s Office to face charges including attempted murder, offences against weapons control regulations, obstructing an officer in discharge of duties, and drug possession.
