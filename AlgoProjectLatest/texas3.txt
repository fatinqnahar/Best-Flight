Police in Texas said on Tuesday a woman who was shot and killed by an officer was not pregnant.

Pamela Turner was heard shouting “I’m pregnant” at a Baytown police officer in a video that captured the Monday night shooting.

Lt Steve Dorris of Baytown police said the department had confirmed the 44-year-old Turner was not pregnant. Dorris did not elaborate on how police learned she was not pregnant. Autopsy results have not been released.

Police say the officer shot Turner after she used his own stun-gun on him during an altercation in Baytown, about 25 miles east of Houston. Police have not released the officer’s name, but say he is an 11-year veteran of the department who was trying to arrest Turner on outstanding warrants, having dealt with her previously.

Video circulating on social media shows Turner and the officer struggling. Dorris said Turner struck the officer in the groin with his own Taser, shocking him, before he fired five shots.

Investigators are trying to contact whoever took the video, because he or she was a witness to the shooting.

In the footage, Turner, who was African American, is heard saying, “You’re actually harassing me” and “I’m actually walking to my house”. Then the woman is on the ground and appears to reach toward the officer. She seems to be heard clearly saying: “I’m pregnant.”

Moments later the officer fired five shots, killing her.

Dorris said the officer was Hispanic and did not suffer serious injuries. “It’s a tragic event for everybody involved,” Dorris said. “Of course, our hearts go out to the family of the deceased as well as our officer.”
